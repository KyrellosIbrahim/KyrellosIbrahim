# **👋 Hello there, I'm is Kyrellos Ibrahim!**

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Belmont University, passionate about developing software apps and creating innovative programming solutions.

### **📚 Education**
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, GPA 3.8/4.0 Belmont University


### **🌟 Featured Projects**
- [Hangman Game](https://github.com/KyrellosIbrahim/HangmanGame): Developed a two-player Hangman game using Python, where one player chooses a word, and the other attempts to guess it within a limited number of tries. The game includes features like input validation for smooth gameplay and a user-friendly interface that handles incorrect guesses, displays the current state of the word, and tracks remaining attempts.
- [Maze Game](https://github.com/KyrellosIbrahim/mazeGame): Created a Java-based maze-solving game where a rat must find its way to a piece of cheese. The program reads maze layouts from text files, allowing dynamic scaling of the maze dimensions. It efficiently finds the shortest path from the start to the goal using the A* algorithm. This project showcases advanced algorithmic thinking, file parsing, and object-oriented programming principles in Java.
- [File Organization Script](https://github.com/KyrellosIbrahim/ImageFileSorter): Designed a Python script to automate the process of organizing image files. The script scans the Downloads folder, identifies image files, and moves them to a specified destination folder, creating the folder if it doesn’t already exist. 

### **💼 Experience**
- ### Researcher, Belmont University (May 2023 - July 2023)

  - Explored electromagnetic phenomena using Python-based simulation tools.
  - Analyzed gold nanospheres' interaction with light, comparing results with Mie Theory.
  - Collaborated as part of a professor-led research team, showcasing strong teamwork and project participation skills.
